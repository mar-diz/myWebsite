# myWebsite
(www.marvindizon.com) I made from scratch. NO CMS like Wordpress or Drupal, and NO HTML Templates

These are the files that I use for my personal, static website hosted on AWS S3 - the domain, www.marvindizon.com, is a domain I bought through godaddy.com so I had to use AWS Route 53 for DNS Forwarding.

I added my github contributions using git-hub calendar (https://github.com/IonicaBizau/github-calendar)

Also added timeMe, the first project I worked on in June, which uses Tableau API to embed a Tableau bar graph on my website.
